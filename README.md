# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This is our main project for our front-end development section at Lighthouse Labs. It is meant to teach and help use practice our HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and our Node, Express back-end skills.

## Getting Started
